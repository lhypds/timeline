These descriptions laid the scientific view of the physical world for the next three centuries and became the foundation of modern engineering. He showed that both the movements of objects on the ground and celestial bodies follow the same natural laws, providing strong theoretical support for the heliocentric theory and advancing the scientific revolution. In mechanics, Newton clarified the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum, and proposed Newton's laws of motion. In optics, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed the theory of color based on the observation of a prism dispersing white light into a visible spectrum. He also systematically stated the law of cooling and studied the speed of sound. In mathematics, Newton shared the honor of developing calculus with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He also proved the generalized binomial theorem, proposed the 'Newton's method' for approaching the zeroes of a function, and made contributions to the study of power series. In economics, Newton proposed the gold standard."
